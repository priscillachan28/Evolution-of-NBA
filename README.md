#### Background <br>
In this project, we will be looking at the trends within the NBA from 1980 to 2017 and how the sport has evolved over the last 40 years. This project will also capture how NBA player positions are classified and determine if positions are classified properly and see if there should be different NBA positions outside of the main five (Center, Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Power Forward, Small Forward). Below are the questions we aim to answer in ths project: <br>
> •	How have NBA players been transforming the game of basketball to take advantage of the different types of scoring methods in the last 40 years? <br>
•	How accurate are the player positions classified? Does the skillset of the player match up with the position that they are labelled? <br>
•	Should the player positions remain the same or should they be revised? <br>
